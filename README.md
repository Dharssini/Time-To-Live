# Life Expectancy Prediction Exploratory Data Analysis & Prediction

Modeling life expectancy is clearly in the realms of statistics but when you extend it to the Internet in an interactive and educational form, it becomes **applied data science**. In this project, we’ll tie a simple linear regression model to a Flask web application, in essence, transforming an equation into an interactive tool from which the entire world can play with and learn from.

The Global Health Observatory is a subsidiary of the World Health Organisation (WHO). GHO collects and publishes more than 1000 health-related indicators for its 194 member states. Here we take a brief look at just a small selection of this data to attempt to discern what mass factors change a countries’ life expectancy, what countries have the highest and lowest life expectancy and why, and if we can estimate life expectancy with just a limited amount of data.

The answers for the following questions one by one is explored in this project:

A. Feature Selection: Do various predicting factors which have been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting life expectancy?

B. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value (<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?

C. How do Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?

D. Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.

E. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?

F. Does Life Expectancy have a positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?

G. Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?

H. What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?
